## Who am I?

I am a software engineer and team lead with more than 20 years of professional experience working primarily on web sites, services & APIs, developer education, and professional development. Most recently I've been focused on distributed systems (Service-Oriented Architectures) and smashing legacy monoliths. While I am not opposed to front-end development roles, I am far more attracted to roles that are focused on back-end projects.

Particular things that I enjoy working on include

+ creating healthy engineering cultures
+ developing sustainable processes
+ robust API development and design
+ team leadership
+ working on distributed systems
+ increasing the professionalism and craftsmanship of teams

My technical background is primarily in OO languages. My daily language for the past 6 years has been Ruby, in which I possess a strong mastery. However, I am interested and open to roles that require learning new languages. Rather than being intimidated by the prospect, I am invigorated at the opportunity to expand my ability to solve problems.

I possess strong written and social leadership skills, and frequently take on project and organizational leadership roles. I am a passionate advocate for understanding software as a means to an end, namely that of solving a human need or desire, and strive to make the end user a stakeholder in everything I do.

I am a frequent public speaker on technical topics, addressing the problem of technical communication with my experience bridging the gaps between disparate interests. I am a teacher and mentor in my various communities, an advocate for hiring and working with junior developers as a critical piece of an engineering organization's long-term health. I engage with others in creating positive communities focused on collaboration and cooperation, and working to promote voices that aren't being heard.

## Who are you?

You are an organization that is making deliberate choices about who you are, where you're going, and how you want to get there. You may have made some wrong turns along the way, but you have a goal in mind and want to get there.

> Just like Thoreau said, I joined a startup to "...to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of [product development] life."  Ok, that doesn't quite work.    
> Deliberate action takes different forms at Pantheon, primarily a) as a company-wide strategy, b) as a product-development organization building tools for developers, and c) as an engineering org building scalable, operable systems.  
> Each of these manifests in different ways, but all efforts strive to maximize our collection efforts and ideas!

You may be 2 people in a garage. You may be 200 spread across 2 cities. You may be 2,000 spread across 4 continents. You understand that scale brings on different sets of challenges at different inflection points, but that it is still all about people.

> Pantheon is ~100 employees, about 60% in San Francisco.  We've scaled our team and our customer base and revenue base and it's still all about the people, the customers hitting the 'Aha!' moments with their web-development workflows and the team members who collaborate and push themselves to deliver and support those experiences.
> The challenges have certainly changed from 6-100 peeps, and I guess it's always been true, but I like where we are today.

You have a focus on employees as individuals, and invest in them, through building a work culture that values collaboration, respect, and empathy, while expecting professionalism, engagement, and craftsmanship. The idea of "confident humility" may not be a phrase you bandy about the office, but it's one that you immediately recognize as being something your culture celebrates.

> Our company values are "Trust", "Teamwork", and "Passion" and reinforce the type of company we want to work in, both in how we interact with our team and our customers.
> To date, I haven't heard "confident humility" bandied about much, although "strong opinions, weakly held" is which implies a confidence to develop and offer opinions along with the humility to accept new and different ideas.

## Where are you?

I have been working remotely for over 3 years, based in the Pacific NorthWest and British Columbia. I would like to continue to be a remote/distributed employee, but am open to relocation to select regions and locations, especially those outside the United States.

> We're headquartered in SF, have an office in Minneappolis, and team members across the US and the globe, including
> Montana, Oregon, Prague, Capetown.  We like to get everyone together a couple times a year; as much as you want to visit, really.

## Specifics

Things that will excite me about your company include:

+ An HR department or designated, experienced person who handles HR issues

> We have designated HR, and I wouldn't want to work anywhere that didn't.  It's not a huge team, but a real part of our commitment to our employees.

+ Flexible schedules - no 9-to-5 clock watching

> A little flexibility goes a long way.  Especially with team members in different timezones, we focus on deliverables and handoffs rather than hours.
> This policy has enabled team members to work remotely (temporarily) from Africa, Europe and Canada in the past several weeks. 

+ Support for employees using company time for things like professional development, open source contributions, and community outreach

> We pay for registration and travel for one local and one domestic prof. develpoment event per year, more if you're presenting.
> We have people on staff with dedicated time twoards Open Source development/outreach, and many who regularly commit to Open Source.
> Our guideline is to invest where the team agrees it is a good use of time.

+ Support for employees improving their skill sets, even if it means they might eventually leave

> Pantheon won't be the last gig for most of our employees, although we've had great retention over the last 5 years.
> I'm pretty sure almost everyone on the engineering team has learned a new language, or significantly improved their competency, while working at Pantheon.
> There is always a lot to learn! We balance the longer-term investment of learning with shorter tearm goals.
> A few things we're collectively learning more of are Golang, Kubernetes, and Domain Driven Design atm.

+ Inclusive health care

> We do.

+ Supportive of local (as you define it) tech communities

> We are deeply involved in Drupal and WordPress communities as part of our business, hosting events, meetups, and sponsoring Open Source work.
> We also work closely with the DevOps/Platform/Infra communities, e.g. sponsoring DevOpsDays MN, Automacon

+ Have a plan to hire more junior developers in the future

> We do. We know we have work, though, to set them up for success!

+ I wouldn't be the only woman on the team

> You wouldn't, and we are actively working on changing our ratio of women, both in engineering and at Pantheon.

+ Growth plan that is 'Who are we, who succeeds here, and how can we be better?'

> Honestly, this is something we are working on and needs more work.  Having this would help everyone maximize their contributions.

+ Active, open, honest discussion about inclusion and diversity

> We're active and open, and frankly behind where we want to be.  One example of our activity is our upcoming sponsorship of the Lesbians Who Tech SF Summit, where we're sending 15% of the company to partake in diversity discussions and recruiting efforts.

+ Solid benefits package that helps employees not worry
    * Competitive salaries
    * Generous or untracked PTO
    * Small, quality-of-life benefits

> Absoluitely.


Things that will make me less interested in your company include:

+ No women or other minorities in technical roles
+ An internal "culture team" that is all-female
+ No HR or plan to deal with HR-related issues
+ No support or involvement in the technical community
+ Benefit plans that nickel-and-dime employees
+ Business plan to extract money from the world, instead of making it better
+ Lack of plan for growth - "Hire everyone now, then we'll figure out our culture"

## Bottom line

Regardless of your industry or business plan, ultimately you are solving real problems that people have, not merely creating diversions for a privileged few.
